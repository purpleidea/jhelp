README file for jhelp.

This installer packages together a set of miscellaneous libraries that I have
written or use often enough to warrant a dedicated repository to be shared by
relevant software that uses these. They are packaged under the name of jhelp.

Some documentation is included inline in the individual modules docstrings.

For newer versions, comments and bug reporting, see the upstream website at:
